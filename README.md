Exploring Global Weather Trends and San Francisco Weather Trends.

### Summary

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of Sna Francisco to overall global temperature trends.

### Objective of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? 
2. Has the difference been consistent over time?
3. “How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
4. What does the overall trend look like? 
5. Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
